# Financial-Transactions-detection-using-ML-Bayesien-Alg-and-Logistic-Regression
The dataset used in this python script is from kaggle : https://www.kaggle.com/ntnu-testimon/paysim1
we would like to build a model that predicts if a transaction is fraud or legitimate so in order to do that we have to use a supervised method of machine learning to be able to predict
First of all, we analayse the dataset to understand it futhermore, we realised some visualisation to make data more readable and understandable
then , we chose to work with the logistic regression and the bayesien algorithm to train the data 
after training and testing , we went on to compare the results of the difference coefficients that can be calculated from the matrix confusion of both methods
finally, we were able to figure out which predictive algorithm was best to predict through the accuracy,precision,F1 score ...
