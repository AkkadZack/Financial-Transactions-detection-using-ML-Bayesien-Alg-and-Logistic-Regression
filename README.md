# Financial-Transactions-detection-using-ML-Bayesien-Alg-and-Logistic-Regression
The dataset used in this python script is from kaggle : https://www.kaggle.com/ntnu-testimon/paysim1
we would like to build a model that predicts if a transaction is fraud or legitimate so in order to do that we have to use a supervised method of machine learning to be able to predict
we chose to work with the logistic regression and the bayesien algorithm to train the data 
after training and testing , we went on to compare the results of the difference coefficients that can be calculated from the matrix confusion of both methods
